For Inovice1, out goal was to create a sales receipt for a sale that contained at least 5 different products. In the sales receipt, we had to include the tax amount at the specified rate, a subtotal before tax, and a grand total after tax. We had to make this without hardcoding the numbers in. I actually enjoyed doing this WOD because I knew quite a lot before having to reference anything. What slowed me down the most was not using shorcuts when typing in all my variables. There was times where I had to copy and paste things multiple times and rename the varaibles accordingly. I ended up just retyping every single variable. This led to minor mistakes that I had to fix later. How I prepared for this WOD was I looked at the things we learned in the past week to understand the concepts before attempting the WOD, like I did with WODS before. I feel that I was very prepsred for this WOD becasue the conepts in my opinion were easy to understand.
