    <p>The goal for assignemnt 2 was to make a working and proper login and registration page. We also needed to make it so that whenver you are about to purchase something, you would be directed to a logi page first. If you didn’t have an account there would be a link that would take you to the registration page to fill out. Once you did that, then it would take you back to the login page to login with the info you provided from registration and once logged in, you would be taken to the invoice page.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I learned how to make user data persistent. What this means is that taking user input and saving what they inputted for later use. In this assignemnt I had to save what they inputted into the registration form and use that for reference when they needed to login. I also learned how to make emails case insensitive and passwords case sensitive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I didn’t work with a partner.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of my “help” was RTFMing and just good old looking up things. I mainly could’ve used help with what I learned in question 2, but I also feel that challenging myself by looking things up is the best practice for real world scenarios. For example, I’m sure I could ask my boss for help when I need it, but if I was always asking for help for every litlle thing, you lose efficiency. I also feel figuring it out myself helps me retain the concepts more.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was differnt becasue we had to implement persistent data and proper “puncutation” for emails and passwords when logging in. I also felt that I didn’t have the best assignemnt 1. So I completely redid it from scratch so that I could read everything easier and it was a little more organized.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I spent about 20% of the time thinking about how to do something, 40% writing code, and 40% testing and debugging.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noticed what worked well for me was starting earlier this time, I was still stressed and struggled quite a bit, but I was much more focused in the sense I tackled problems one step at a time vs attempting to do everything all at once.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only thing I would do differently is working on the assignment during the day time rather than night only because I get more done during that time. I would’ve also considered maybe grabbing a partner since the assignment can be a lot to take in, especailly in my case since I started assignment 2 from scratch.</p>
