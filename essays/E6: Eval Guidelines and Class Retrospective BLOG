    1. Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)
    My store is a sticker shop. The stickers are broken down into three categories, Hawaii, Sports, and Random.

    2. Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?
    One shortcoming is not getting the email to work. I tried implementing using mutliple methods, but it just wouldn't seem to work. I can see why it may be useful to work in groups, especially if there is a lot of work to do.

    3. Describe what you are most proud of about your system:
    I am most proud of being able to store the cart info using cookies and session. I can say that this and many other things I learned in this class will be useful in the future.

    4. Describe what you are least happy with your system:
    I would say that I'm disappinted in the look of the system. Although it has still improved a lot since Assignment1, it still could use some work.

    5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?
    The biggest difference was the use of cookies and sessions. Honestly for me, I can understand the concept of cookies and sessions, but implementing it is a whole different beast.

    6. When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?
    RTFM. I did a lot of looking up of things and researching. It is the main reason why my Assignments were not completed fully.

    7. Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?
    I would say my time management was much better. Assignment1 and 2 I turned in late, but this assignment, I was able to turn it in a day early.

    8. Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?
    What didn't work well in my software was the email. I tried implementing it using different methods, most of which I either couldn't fully understand, or it was very complicated to me, and I still couldn't get it to work properly.

    9. What did you learn from doing this assignment?
    I learned that as projects become more complex and bigger in size, working with others should come first over trying to retain every little deatil, because in reality, I can look it up if I forget something.

    10. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?
    I can now say with confidence, I would defnitely work in a group. I think looking at things from different classmates perspectives might've helped me when I got stuck and had to RTFM.

    11. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
    a. 30%
    b. 10%
    c. 60%
    
    12. Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)
    I didn't have a partner for this Assignment.
